Seamless Navigation Enhancement with Smooth Animations
---
Progress Summary:
Today, we focused on refining the navigation functionality of your website. Specifically, we addressed the following:
1. Navigation Visibility and Animation: We worked on ensuring that the navigation bar and language switcher are hidden by default and smoothly animated into view when the user clicks on the sandwich menu. Initially, there was a brief flash of the navigation elements upon page load, which we resolved by keeping them hidden with `opacity: 0` and `visibility: hidden` until the sandwich menu is clicked.
2. Smooth Toggle Animation: We successfully implemented animations for the navigation links and the language switcher. Now, when the sandwich menu is clicked, the elements smoothly slide down into view with an elegant transition, making the user experience more professional and polished.
3. Restoring the Previous Version: After experimenting with various methods to hide and show the navigation, we reverted to the original solution where the navigation remains hidden using `opacity` and `visibility` and is animated on click. This version now works perfectly without any flashing issues during the initial page load.
